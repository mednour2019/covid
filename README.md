# COVID Management Application
# The project is in master Branch
# Description
This COVID Management Application is a scholarship project proposed by me during this academic year, which was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the professor only required a MongoDB database application, I chose to focus on COVID-19. The application is designed to manage users with COVID-19, track the disease's spread, and provide statistics by city. It also manages the status of individuals (dead, not dead, test positive, negative) and generates statistical charts.
