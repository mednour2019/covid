COVID Management Application
Technologies: c# , .net framework WPF , Mongo db , Metro framework
Description
This COVID Management Application is a scholarship project proposed by me during this academic year, which was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the professor only required a MongoDB database application, I chose to focus on COVID-19. The application is designed to manage users with COVID-19, track the disease's spread, and provide statistics by city. It also manages the status of individuals (dead, not dead, test positive, negative) and generates statistical charts.

Key Features
1. Login Interface: Secure login interface for accessing the COVID management application.
2. Patient Management: Efficiently manage and track patients with COVID-19, including their status and test results.
3. City-Based Patient Statistics: Provide city-specific statistics to better understand the impact of COVID-19 in different areas.
4. COVID Test Results and Statistics: Track and generate statistics on COVID-19 test results, including positive and negative cases, with statistical curves.
5. Final Patient Outcome: Monitor and provide statistics on patient outcomes, including deceased and recovered, categorized by city and gender.
